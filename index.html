              <p class="lead">
                The Lisle Woman’s Club, charted in 1963, is affiliated with the General Federation of Woman’s Clubs (GFWC) and the Illinois Federation of Women’s Clubs (GFWC-IL).
                The General Federation of Women’s Clubs, one of the world’s largest and oldest nonpartisan, nondenominational women’s volunteer service organizations, was founded in 1890 and chartered by the 56th United States Congress in 1901.
                GFWC has a long history of philanthropy, social and political advocacy, and community leadership. More than100,000 members in affiliated clubs in every state and more than a dozen countries work in their own communities to support the arts, preserve natural resources, advance education, promote healthy lifestyles, encourage civic involvement, and work toward world peace and understanding.
                GFWC is responsible for the establishment of 75% of America’s public libraries. One of the first major projects of the Lisle Woman’s Club was the creation of a junior public library. It was staffed by LWC volunteers and contained donated books and furniture. The library opened on April 12, 1964, in a rent-free basement room at 4742 Main St. Soon adult books were added to the collection. In February and May in 1964, members took time out from the library activities to help with the Sabin Polio Vaccine Program in Lisle.
                LWC, the newly formed Friends of the Lisle Library group, and other organizations and individuals then successfully worked to promote passage of the December 1965 referendum to establish a Lisle Library District.
                Throughout the intervening years, LWC members have devoted countless volunteer hours to philanthropy and community service to benefit our community.

              <p class="lead">	Our purposes are to serve the community through fund-raising and philanthropy and to promote friendship among area women through club activities.
                The Lisle Woman’s Club (LWC), chartered in 1963, is a member club of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs (GFWC)-Illinois and Illinois Fifth District.
                The Lisle Woman’s Club started a Volunteer Public Library in 1964 in a basement on Main Street.  LWC continued to operate the Library, while working with other groups and individuals for the formation of a tax-supported Lisle Library District. The Library District was approved by Referendum in December 1965, and opened in September 1967.  Throughout the Library’s progress LWC has remained vitally interested and we maintain our close relationship with the staff and programs
